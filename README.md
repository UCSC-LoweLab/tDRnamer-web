## tDRnamer web server

### About
tDRnamer provides a consistent, stable name with annotations for submitted tDR sequences based 
on the described naming system. It consists of a standalone version that can be run on a Linux/Unix 
platform with a large data set including pre-processed small RNA-seq reads (FASTQ file format) 
and tDR sequences (FASTA file format). Researchers who have a smaller set of tDR sequences or 
prefer to use a point-and-click environment can utilize the web-based version at 
[http://trna.ucsc.edu/tDRnamer/](http://trna.ucsc.edu/tDRnamer/) that does not require any software 
installation. Moreover, tDRnamer can take tDR names that are formatted according to our naming 
system and obtain the corresponding sequences with related annotations.

This repository contains the source code of the web server application. For the source code of the 
standalone version, please visit the [tDRnamer repository](https://github.com/UCSC-LoweLab/tDRnamer).
